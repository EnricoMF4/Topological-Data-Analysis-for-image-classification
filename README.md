# TDA for image classification

## Overview

This project concerns the use of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for classification of different types of images. I have merged and selected some approaches used in the papers reported in the bibliography.
I implemented in Python the classification experiments on four different image datasets: a generic dataset of texture, MNIST, FMNIST and SHERC14. The first three reguards 2-d images, while the last one 3-d images.

For each experiment there's a different file utils. You can find the report of results and of working plane in the presentation.

## Prerequisites

Python3 (I have tested it with Python3.9.6)
