# TDA for image classification

## Overview

This project concerns the use of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for classification of different types of images. I have merged and selected some approaches used in the papers reported in the bibliography.
I implemented in Python the classification experiments on four different image datasets: a generic dataset of textures, [MNIST](Code/MNIST), [FMNIST](Code/FMNIST) and [SHREC14](Code/SHREC14). The first three reguards 2-d images, while the last one 3-d images.

For each experiment there's a different file utils. You can find the report of results and of working plane in the [presentation](Presentation/TDAforimageclassification.pptx).

Due to memory reasons, I have not uploaded the datasets about the textures and SHREC14, you can import them online.

## Prerequisites

Python3 (I have tested it with Python3.9.6)
