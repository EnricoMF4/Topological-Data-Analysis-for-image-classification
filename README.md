# TDA for image classification

## Overview

This project concerns the use of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for classification of different types of images. I have merged and selected some approaches used in the papers reported in the bibliography below.
I implemented in Python the classification experiments on four different image datasets: a generic dataset of textures, [MNIST](Code/MNIST), [FMNIST](Code/FMNIST) and [SHREC14](Code/SHREC14). The first three reguards 2-d images, while the last one 3-d images.

I uploaded the experiments about the last three datasets, including a utils file for each of them. You can find the explanation of the experiments and the report of the results in the [presentation](Presentation).

Due to memory reasons, I have not uploaded the SHREC14 dataset, that you can easily find online.

## Prerequisites

Python3 (I have tested it with Python3.9.6)
